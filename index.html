	<p>I currently live in Austin, TX, but Michigan will forever be my home. Eighty-Three Counties of Michigan is a passion project I started a while back that I wanted to give a face lift to. Every county gets an emblem and a short history lesson.</p><br>

	<p>The Detroit Red Wings are a passion for me, so when I went about creating a schedule for the 2014-2015 season, I wanted to make it something special. Looking at NHL.com and trying to wade through the garbage to get to a schedule has always been a huge bummer to me. So I wanted mine to be accessible from all devices and simple to navigate. This was my first foray into fluid grids and a fly out nav.</p><br>

	<a href="http://kalinwood.com/wedding/" target="_blank"><h2 class="h-link">/wedding</h2></a>
	<p>I’m getting married to the love of my life! This is just a simple site to announce our engagement that I plan on updating with information regarding the wedding.</p><br>

	<a href="http://kalinwood.com/sloppycode/" target="_blank"><h2 class="h-link">/sloppycode</h2></a>
	<p>I  was getting sick of dredging through my past site’s code to get those simple ease effects or the standard reset, so I made a site to keep it all in one place. Obviously I will be updating this once I have more, including a few grids I have made since.</p><br>

	<a href="http://kalinwood.com/austin/" target="_blank"><h2 class="h-link">/austin</h2></a>
	<p>This site was more of an announcement to my former co-workers (whom I adore) that I was leaving and moving on from DC to Austin to start a new chapter. I had a fun time with it.</p><br>

	<a href="http://kalinwood.com/pavel/" target="_blank"><h2 class="h-link">/pavel</h2></a>
	<p>Pavel Datsyuk is the most exciting hockey player in the league to watch. I watch highlight after highlight and wanted to share some of my favorite gifs with people that felt the same way. His nickname is “The Magician” for a reason. This was my first time using a plugin to pull random images on refresh. </p><br>

<div class="wrap">
	<a href="http://kalinwood.com/lshex/" target="_blank"><h2 class="h-link">/lshex</h2></a>
	<p>While working at LivingSocial, I wanted to give everyone access to the hex values we use on the site since they would change every once and a while. This also helped with communicating with engineers so that we were all on the same page.</p><br>

	<a href="http://kalinwood.com/lsmodal/" target="_blank"><h2 class="h-link">/lsmodal</h2></a>
	<p>I was having a hard time explaining how the share buttons would work on a modal for LivingSocial, so I took my shot at making a prototype. Nothing fancy, but it ended up helping with the final development.</p><br>

	<a href="http://kalinwood.com/hexy/" target="_blank"><h2 class="h-link">/hexy</h2></a>
	<p>It was pretty trendy a few months back to create a color palette site so I took a stab at it. It was a lot of fun to make even if it’s sorta difficult to use. Art for art’s sake.</p><br>

	<a href="http://kalinwood.com/cv/" target="_blank"><h2 class="h-link">/cv</h2></a>
	<p>I needed to update my resume and decided to make a responsive site so that people could view it anywhere. It’s a little janky so I’ll be revisiting this soon.</p><br>

	<a href="http://kalinwood.com/albums2013/" target="_blank"><h2 class="h-link">/albums2013</h2></a>
	<p>2013 was a big year in music. I tend to have my headphones on 96% of the time while I work, so I get through a lot of music. This was just a recap on my favorite albums. I excited to make this an annual thing.</p><br>

	<a href="http://kalinwood.com/lsport2013/" target="_blank"><h2 class="h-link">/lsport2013</h2></a>
	<p>I had to create a bit of a retrospective for my work done in 2013 for LivingSocial and decided to bypass the standard PDF with a site, highlighting one of my biggest achievements of the year, learning a bit of HTML &amp CSS.</p><br>

<div class="wrap">
	<a href="http://kalinwood.com/avatard/" target="_blank"><h2 class="h-link">/avatard</h2></a>
	<p>One of my earlier sites using a responsive grid (Toast by Dan Eden) for the first time. It really taught me how media queries work and what the limitations are. It’s not great, but I like keeping it around to see my development since.</p><br>

<div class="wrap">
	<a href="http://kalinwood.com/wings1314" target="_blank"><h2 class="h-link">/wings1314</h2></a>
	<p>This was the first Detroit Red Wings schedule I made for the 2013-2014 season. I really just needed an excuse to try a sticky side nav and responsive layout. I learned a lot from this one.</p><br>

<div class="wrap">
	<a href="http://kalinwood.com/support-detroit/" target="_blank"><h2 class="h-link">/support-detroit</h2></a>
	<p>The first site I made from the ground up, aside from my homepage. I wanted to see what I could do using a bit of the twitter api and it was right after Detroit filed for bankruptcy. I wanted to do something to raise my spirits and show my support.</p><br>
